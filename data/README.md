# Get the data!

I am not including the World Values Survey (WVS) data in this Git repo, since it is not mine to include.

If you want to follow along with my code, you should download the data from their website!
http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp

I'm using Wave6 data, Wave6 being the wave of surveys conducted between 2010 and 2014.

### You need:

1. The codebook file named "F00003861-WV6_Codebook_v_2014_11_07.xls", and
2. The results file named "WV6_Data_ascii_delimited_v_2016_01_01.dat" (which is secretly a CSV file)

Place 'em in this folder and you should be good to go!
